  abstract  = {This paper presents a formalization of Nuprl’s metatheory in Coq. It includes a nominal-style definition of the Nuprl language, its reduction rules, a coinductive computational equivalence, and a Curry- style type system where a type is defined as a Partial Equivalence Relation (PER) à la Allen. This type system includes Martin-Löf dependent types, a hierarchy of universes, inductive types and partial types. We then prove that the typehood rules of Nuprl are valid w.r.t. this PER semantics and hence reduce Nuprl’s consistency to Coq’s consistency.},

  abstract = {Dependent type theories have a long history of being used for theorem proving. One aspect of type theory which makes it very powerful as a proof language is that it mixes deduction with computation. This also makes type theory a good candidate for programming---the strength of the type system allows properties of programs to be stated and established, and the computational properties provide semantics for the programs. This thesis is concerned with bridging the gap between the theoretical presentations of type theory and the requirements on a practical programming language. Although there are many challenging research problems left to solve before we have an industrial scale programming language based on type theory, this thesis takes us a good step along the way.},

  abstract      = {The dependency core calculus (DCC) is a framework for studying a variety of dependency analyses (e.g., secure information flow). The key property provided by DCC is noninterference, which guarantees that a low-level observer (attacker) cannot distinguish high-level (protected) computations. The proof of noninterference for DCC suggests a connection to parametricity in System F, which suggests that it should be possible to implement dependency analyses in languages with parametric polymorphism. We present a translation from DCC into F$\omega$ and prove that the translation preserves noninterference. To express noninterference in F$\omega$, we define a notion of observer-sensitive equivalence that makes essential use of both first-order and higher-order polymorphism. Our translation provides insights into DCC's type system and shows how DCC can be implemented in a polymorphic language without loss of the noninterference (security) guarantees available in DCC. Our contributions include proof techniques that should be valuable when proving other secure compilation or full abstraction results.},

  abstract  = {The design space for type systems that support impredicative instantiation is extremely complicated, in which one needs to strike a balance between expressiveness, simplicity for both the end programmer and the type system implementor, and how easily the system can be integrated with other advanced type system concepts. In this paper, we propose a new point in the design space, which we call guarded impredicativity. Its key idea is that impredicative instantiation in an application is allowed for type variables that occur under a type constructor.

The resulting type system has a clean declarative specification --- making it easy for programmers to predict what will type and what will not --- allows for a smooth integration with GHC's OutsideIn(X) constraint solving framework, while giving up very little in terms of expressiveness compared to systems like HMF, HML, FPH and MLF. We give a sound and complete inference algorithm, and prove a principal type property for our system.},

  abstract = {In the pure Calculus of Constructions, it is possible to represent data structures  and predicates using higher-order quantification. However, this representation is not  satisfactory, from the point of view of both the efficiency of the underlying programs  and the power of the logical system. For these reasons, the calculus was extended  with a primitive notion of inductive definitions [8]. This paper describes the rules for  inductive definitions in the system Coq. They are general enough to be seen as one  formulation of adding inductive definitions to a typed lambda-calculus. We prove  strong normalization for a subsystem of Coq corresponding to the pure Calculus of  Constructions plus Inductive Definitions with only weak non-dependent eliminations.},

  abstract = {Martin-Lof&#039;s type theory is presented in several steps. The kernel is a dependently typed -calculus.  Then there are schemata for inductive sets and families of sets and for primitive recursive functions and families of functions. Finally, there are set formers (generic polymorphism) and universes. At each step syntax, inference rules, and set-theoretic semantics are given. 1 Introduction  Usually Martin-Lof&#039;s type theory is presented as a closed system with rules for a finite collection of set formers. But it is also often pointed out that the system is in principle open to extension: we may introduce new sets when there is a need for them. The principle is that a set is by definition inductively generated - it is defined by its introduction rules, which are rules for generating its elements. The elimination rule is determined by the introduction rules and expresses definition by primitive recursion on the way the elements of the set are generated. (In this paper I shall use the term ...},

  abstract    = {We propose a new formal criterion for secure compilation, giving strong end-to-end security guarantees for software components written in unsafe, low-level languages with C-style undefined behavior. Our criterion is the first to model_dynamic_ compromise in a system of mutually distrustful components running with least privilege. Each component is protected from all the others---in particular, from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become compromised. Each component receives secure compilation guarantees up to the point when it becomes compromised, after which an attacker can take complete control over the component and use any of its privileges to attack the remaining uncompromised components. More precisely, we ensure that dynamically compromised components cannot break the safety properties of the system at the target level any more than equally privileged components without undefined behavior already could in the source language. To illustrate this model, we build a secure compilation chain for an unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components. We compile it to a simple RISC abstract machine with built-in compartmentalization and provide thorough proofs, many of them machine-checked in Coq, showing that the compiler satisfies our secure compilation criterion. Finally, we show that the protection guarantees offered by the compartmentalized abstract machine can be achieved at the machine-code level using either software fault isolation or a tag-based reference monitor.},

  abstract    = {Compartmentalization is good security-engineering practice. By breaking a large software system into mutually distrustful components that run with minimal privileges, restricting their interactions to conform to well-defined interfaces, we can limit the damage caused by low-level attacks such as control-flow hijacking. When used to defend against such attacks, compartmentalization is often implemented cooperatively by a compiler and a low-level compartmentalization mechanism. However, the formal guarantees provided by such compartmentalizing compilation have seen surprisingly little investigation. We propose a new security property, secure compartmentalizing compilation (SCC), that formally characterizes the guarantees provided by compartmentalizing compilation and clarifies its attacker model. We reconstruct our property by starting from the well-established notion of fully abstract compilation, then identifying and lifting three important limitations that make standard full abstraction unsuitable for compartmentalization. The connection to full abstraction allows us to prove SCC by adapting established proof techniques; we illustrate this with a compiler from a simple unsafe imperative language with procedures to a compartmentalized abstract machine.},

Fusion is concise as the programmer need only write signatures for (externally exported) top-level functions and places with cyclic (recursive) dependencies, after which Fusion can predictably synthesize the most precise refinement types for all intermediate terms (expressible in the decidable refinement logic), thereby checking the program without false alarms. We have implemented Fusion and evaluated it on the benchmarks from the LiquidHaskell suite totalling about 12KLOC. Fusion checks an existing safety benchmark suite using about half as many templates as previously required and nearly 2x faster. In a new set of theorem proving benchmarks Fusion is both 10 - 50x faster and, by synthesizing the most precise types, avoids false alarms to make verification possible.},

  abstract = {This work introduces the theory of illative combinatory algebras, which is closely related to systems of illative combinatory logic. We thus provide a semantic interpretation for a formal framework in which both logic and computation may be expressed in a unified manner. Systems of illative combinatory logic consist of combinatory logic extended with constants and rules of inference intended to capture logical notions. Our theory does not correspond strictly to any traditional system, but draws inspiration from many. It differs from them in that it couples the notion of truth with the notion of equality between terms, which enables the use of logical formulas in conditional expressions. We give a consistency proof for first-order illative combinatory algebras. A complete embedding of classical predicate logic into our theory is also provided. The translation is very direct and natural.},

  title       = {Practical Sized Typing for Coq},
  abstract    = {Termination of recursive functions and productivity of corecursive functions are important for maintaining logical consistency in proof assistants. However, contemporary proof assistants, such as Coq, rely on syntactic criteria that prevent users from easily writing obviously terminating or productive programs, such as quicksort. This is troublesome, since there exist theories for type-based termination- and productivity-checking. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of sized type checking and inference for Coq. We extend past work on sized types for the Calculus of (Co)Inductive Constructions (CIC) with support for global definitions found in Gallina, and extend the sized-type inference algorithm to support completely unannotated Gallina terms. This allows our design to maintain complete backward compatibility with existing Coq developments. We provide an implementation that extends the Coq kernel with optional support for sized types.},
