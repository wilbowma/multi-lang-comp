@title{A-normal Form}
We start by presenting the source language and the ANF "translation".
Most compiler correctness papers use CPS at the first pass, but we use ANF since
there is already a presentation of ANF as a reduction relation.
We extend the A-reductions to support some Scheme-like imperative features.
