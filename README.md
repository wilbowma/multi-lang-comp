Compilation as Multi-Language Semantics
==
This repo is my notebook on studying multi-language semantics and compilation.

The most recent document is the [prisc2021-abstract.scrbl]("PriSC 2021 extended
abstract").

[sketch.md]() is an early draft explaining the idea at a high level.
[notes.md]() are misc notes.
